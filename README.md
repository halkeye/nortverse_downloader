# nortverse-downloader

Light little script to download https://nortverse.com into cbz files

## History

I really love the comic, but don't like reading on the website. I am subscribing to the patreon, then importing the comic into kavita so I can read it easier.

## Usage

```
go install github.com/halkeye/nortverse-downloader@latest
```
